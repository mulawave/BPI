BPI TOKEN (BPT) DEFLATIONARY MODEL
Version 3 – TECH & SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF
To: CTO, BPI Technology Team
From: BPI Management
Subject: BPI Token Buy-Back & Burn Logic (Deflationary Control)


1.	Objective
To introduce a transparent, automated, and sustainable deflationary mechanism for BPI Token (BPT) that:
●	Reduces circulating supply over time

●	Increases long-term token value

●	Aligns rewards with ecosystem sustainability

●	Builds community trust through public visibility




2.	Scope of Application
This deflationary logic must be applied across:

1.	BPI Store

2.	BPI Token Wallet

3.	Membership Activations

4.	Membership Renewals

5.	Any BPI product or service that rewards BPI Token (BPT)
 
 

3.	Core Deflation Rule (50 / 50 Split)
Whenever BPI Token (BPT) is generated as:

●	Loyalty reward

●	Cashback

●	Membership reward

●	Renewal incentive

●	Store reward


The amount must be split automatically as follows:
●	50% → Member Wallet (Visible & Usable)

●	50% → BPI Token Buy-Back Wallet (Invisible to Member)


📌 Important:
Members only see and interact with the 50% credited to their wallet.
The remaining 50% is system-routed to Buy-Back, not visible to the user.


4.	BPI Token Buy-Back Wallet (Public Wallet)
A dedicated BPI Token Buy-Back Wallet must be created with the following properties:

Wallet Characteristics
●	Publicly viewable (read-only)

●	Not user-accessible

●	Admin-controlled execution

●	Auditable on-chain
 
Wallet Displays
The Buy-Back Wallet dashboard must show:

●	Total balance (₦ value)

●	Total balance ($ value)

●	The equivalent number of BPI Tokens (BPT) it can buy

●	Historical buy-back events

●	Historical burn events




5.	Buy-Back & Burn Execution Logic
Step 1: Accumulation
●	All 50% deflation allocations flow continuously into the Buy-Back Wallet.


Step 2: Buy-Back Trigger
●	When Management or Admin triggers a buy-back:

○	Funds in the Buy-Back Wallet are used to repurchase BPI Tokens (BPT) from circulation.


Step 3: Burn Mechanism
●	All BPI Tokens bought back are:

○	Sent to a burn address

○	Permanently removed from circulation


📌 Burn events must be logged and visible:
 
●	Date

●	Amount of BPT burned

●	₦ value

●	$ value

●	Transaction hash




6.	Transparency & Community Trust
The following must be publicly visible:

●	Total BPT allocated to buy-back

●	Total BPT burned to date

●	Remaining circulating supply (optional)

●	Buy-back wallet balance in real time


This reinforces:

Trust, transparency, and long-term value protection


7.	Wallet & UI Behavior
Member Wallet
●	Shows only 50% of earned BPT

●	No indication of the other 50% (handled silently by the system)


Admin / Public Dashboard
 
●	Displays:

○	Buy-Back Wallet balance

○	Burn history

○	Token deflation metrics




8.	Governance & Control
●	Buy-Back execution requires:

○	Admin or MGT approval

●	Burn action is irreversible

●	Logs must be immutable and auditable




9.	Summary for CTO
Key Rules to Implement:

●	50% BPT reward → Member Wallet

●	50% BPT reward → Buy-Back Wallet

●	Buy-Back Wallet accumulates funds

●	Buy-Back triggers repurchase

●	Repurchased BPT is burned

●	Public visibility of values and burns


This creates a true deflationary token economy aligned with BPI’s long-term vision.
 
On a final note: make provision for the BPT buy-back wallet to be linked to other wallets that share revenue in the system. Admin can add the buyback BPI wallet to be a beneficiary and set the % share.
