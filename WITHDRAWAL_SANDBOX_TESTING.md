## Setup for Sandbox Testing

### 1. Configure Flutterwave Sandbox Keys

**Option A: Via Admin Panel**
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to `/admin/settings`
3. Find "Payment Gateway Configuration"
4. Select "Flutterwave"
5. Enter sandbox credentials:
   ```
   Public Key: FLWPUBK_TEST-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   Secret Key: FLWSECK_TEST-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   Environment: Test/Sandbox
   ```
6. Save configuration

**Option B: Via Database**
```sql
INSERT INTO "PaymentGatewayConfig" (
  id,
  "gatewayName",
  "publicKey",
  "secretKey",
  "webhookSecret",
  "isActive",
  "environment",
  "createdAt",
  "updatedAt"
) VALUES (
  'flw-sandbox-001',
  'flutterwave',
  'FLWPUBK_TEST-your-public-key',
  'FLWSECK_TEST-your-secret-key',
  'your-webhook-secret',
  true,
  'sandbox',
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);
```

### 2. Set Auto-Approval Threshold

For testing both auto and manual approval:

```sql
INSERT INTO "AdminSettings" (id, "settingKey", "settingValue", description, "updatedAt")
VALUES ('auto-threshold-001', 'AUTO_WITHDRAWAL_THRESHOLD', '100000', 'Auto-approve withdrawals below this amount (in NGN)', NOW())
ON CONFLICT ("settingKey") DO UPDATE SET "settingValue" = '100000';
```

This means:
- Withdrawals < ₦100,000 → Auto-approved (Flutterwave transfer in 3s)
- Withdrawals ≥ ₦100,000 → Manual approval required

### 3. Add Test Bank Account

Users need a bank account for withdrawals. Add via:

**SQL:**
```sql
INSERT INTO "BankRecord" (
  id,
  "userId",
  "accountNumber",
  "accountName",
  "bankId",
  "isDefault",
  "createdAt"
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'your-user-id',
  '0123456789',
  'Test User',
  'bank-id-from-Bank-table',
  true,
  NOW()
);
```

**Or via UI:**
1. Login as user
2. Navigate to `/settings/bank-accounts`
3. Add bank account
4. Mark as default

### Scenario 3: Flutterwave Error (Sandbox)

**Purpose:** Test error handling when Flutterwave fails

**Steps:**
1. Use invalid bank code or account number
2. Submit withdrawal (auto-approved amount)

**Expected Terminal Output:**
```
[... initial steps same as Scenario 1 ...]

🌐 [FLUTTERWAVE-API] Initiating bank transfer...
📤 [FLUTTERWAVE-API] Sending request to Flutterwave...
📥 [FLUTTERWAVE-API] Response received. Status: 400 Bad Request
❌ [FLUTTERWAVE-API] Request failed: 400 {error details}
❌ [FLUTTERWAVE-API] Error initiating transfer: Error: Flutterwave transfer error: Bad Request - {details}

❌ [WITHDRAWAL] Processing error: Error: Flutterwave transfer error: Bad Request
Error details: Flutterwave transfer error: Bad Request - Invalid account number
🔄 [WITHDRAWAL] Initiating refund...
✅ [WITHDRAWAL] User refunded successfully
📧 [NOTIFICATION] User notified of failure
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Verification:**
- User wallet refunded
- Transaction status = "failed"
- User receives failure notification

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Logs Appearing

**Check:**
1. Server is running in development mode (`npm run dev`)
2. Not running in production mode (logs may be suppressed)
3. Terminal/console is visible and not hidden

### Issue: Flutterwave Transfer Fails

**Common Causes:**
1. **Invalid Secret Key**
   - Log shows: `🔑 [FLUTTERWAVE-API] Using secret key: undefined`
   - Fix: Set secret key in admin panel or PaymentGatewayConfig table

2. **Wrong Environment**
   - Using live key in sandbox or vice versa
   - Fix: Ensure `FLWSECK_TEST-` prefix for sandbox

3. **Invalid Bank Code**
   - Log shows: `400 Bad Request - Invalid bank code`
   - Fix: Use valid Flutterwave bank codes (e.g., '058' for GTBank)

4. **Invalid Account Number**
   - Log shows: `Could not resolve account`
   - Fix: In sandbox, use test account numbers provided by Flutterwave

5. **Insufficient Flutterwave Balance**
   - Log shows: `Insufficient balance`
   - Fix: Sandbox accounts have virtual balance, contact Flutterwave support

### Issue: User Not Receiving Emails

**Check:**
1. SMTP configured (see ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md)
2. Email logs show success:
   ```
   ✅ [EMAIL] Admin notifications sent successfully
   ```
3. Check spam folder
4. Verify email address in user profile

### Issue: Withdrawal Not Showing in Admin Panel

**Check:**
1. Transaction status is "pending"
2. Transaction type is "WITHDRAWAL_CASH" or "WITHDRAWAL_BPT"
3. Admin panel badge count updates (refresh page)
4. Check database directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "Transaction" 
   WHERE status = 'pending' 
   AND "transactionType" IN ('WITHDRAWAL_CASH', 'WITHDRAWAL_BPT')
   ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
   ```

---

## Sandbox-Specific Notes

### Flutterwave Sandbox Behavior

1. **No Real Money:** All transactions are simulated
2. **Instant Processing:** Transfers complete immediately (no bank delays)
3. **Test Accounts:** Use Flutterwave-provided test account numbers
4. **Virtual Balance:** Sandbox accounts have unlimited virtual balance
5. **No Verification Required:** Sandbox may skip certain verifications
6. **Webhooks:** Webhooks may not fire in sandbox (test manually)

### Test Bank Codes (Nigeria)
```
058 - GTBank (Guaranty Trust Bank)
033 - United Bank for Africa
011 - First Bank of Nigeria
044 - Access Bank
057 - Zenith Bank
214 - First City Monument Bank
215 - Unity Bank
032 - Union Bank
```

### Test Account Numbers
Flutterwave provides test accounts for each bank. Contact Flutterwave support or check their documentation for current test account numbers.

---

## Verifying Successful Withdrawals

### 1. Check Terminal Logs
Look for final success message:
```
✅ [WITHDRAWAL] Auto-approved withdrawal completed successfully
```
or
```
✅ [ADMIN-APPROVAL] Withdrawal approval completed successfully
```

### 2. Check Database
```sql
-- Verify transaction status
SELECT id, "userId", amount, status, "gatewayReference", "transactionType", "createdAt"
FROM "Transaction"
WHERE reference = 'WD-CASH-1738425600000'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;

-- Verify wallet deduction
SELECT wallet FROM "User" WHERE id = 'user-id';

-- Verify withdrawal history
SELECT * FROM "WithdrawalHistory"
WHERE "userId" = 'user-id'
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 3. Check Flutterwave Dashboard
1. Login to Flutterwave sandbox dashboard
2. Navigate to Transfers
3. Find transfer by reference
4. Verify status, amount, beneficiary

## Log Filtering Tips

### Filter by Component
```bash
# Only Flutterwave logs
npm run dev | grep "FLUTTERWAVE"

# Only admin approval logs
npm run dev | grep "ADMIN-APPROVAL"

# Only email logs
npm run dev | grep "EMAIL"
```

### Filter by Status
```bash
# Only errors
npm run dev | grep "❌"

# Only successes
npm run dev | grep "✅"
```

### Save Logs to File
```bash
# Save all logs
npm run dev > withdrawal-test.log 2>&1

# Save only Flutterwave logs
npm run dev 2>&1 | grep "FLUTTERWAVE" > flutterwave.log
```

---

## Next Steps After Testing

### 1. Switch to Production
Once sandbox testing is successful:

1. Get production credentials from Flutterwave
2. Update PaymentGatewayConfig with live keys
3. Set environment to "production"
4. Test with small real amount first
5. Monitor logs for 24 hours

### 2. Configure Webhooks
1. Set webhook URL in Flutterwave dashboard:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/flutterwave
   ```
2. Set webhook secret
3. Test webhook delivery

### 3. Monitor Production
- Set up error alerts (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Monitor Flutterwave dashboard daily
- Review audit logs weekly
- Track withdrawal success rates
