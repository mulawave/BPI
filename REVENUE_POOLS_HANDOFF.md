## 🔧 Critical Fix Applied

### Auth System Bug (Fixed)

**Issue:**  
User sessions always had `role: "user"` even for admin users, causing 403 Forbidden errors on all revenue pool endpoints (e.g., `searchUsers` endpoint).

**Root Cause:**  
The auth configuration in `server/auth.ts` was trying to access `user.role` from the database, but the User model uses `user.userType` field instead.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `server/auth.ts` line 44: Changed `role: user.role ?? "user"` to `role: user.userType ?? "user"`
- Added line 86: `token.role = dbUser?.userType ?? "user";` to refresh role from database on each request

**Admin Users in Database:**
Currently 4 users with `userType='admin'`:
1. admin@superapp.bpi
2. richardobroh@gmail.com
3. drgileadokolonkwo@gmail.com
4. quicksave01@gmail.com

**Important:** Users need to log out and log back in for the session to pick up their admin role.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. TypeScript Error (Non-Blocking)

**File:** `server/trpc/router/revenue.ts`  
**Line:** 703  
**Error:** `Type '{ Transactions: ... }' is not assignable to type 'never'`

**Status:** Non-blocking - code works at runtime  
**Cause:** TypeScript type narrowing issue with conditional includes  
**Workaround:** Function has `Promise<any>` return type  
**Impact:** None - dev server runs successfully, production builds work

**Suggested Fix (Optional):**
```typescript
// Use discriminated union or separate functions for different return types
```

### 2. ESLint Warnings (Scripts Only)

**Files:**
- `scripts/audit.js` (lines 1-2)
- `scripts/audit-revenue-pools.ts` (lines 254, 263)

**Error:** `A require() style import is forbidden`

**Status:** Does not affect build  
**Cause:** CommonJS require() in standalone scripts  
**Impact:** None - scripts are not part of the build process

## 📝 Next Steps (Recommendations)

### Immediate (If Needed)
1. **User Session Refresh:**
   - Admin users need to log out and log back in for role to update
   - Session tokens need regeneration with correct `role` from `userType`

2. **TypeScript Error Resolution (Optional):**

## 🔑 Important Context & Conventions

### User Model Fields
- **userType:** String field with values "user", "admin", "super_admin" (default: "user")
- **NO role field:** Common mistake - the field is `userType`, not `role`
- **Session mapping:** `session.user.role` is populated from database `userType` field

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in via credentials provider
2. Auth callback reads `user.userType` from database
3. Maps to `token.role` in JWT
4. JWT callback refreshes `token.role` from database on each request (line 86)
5. Session callback exposes `session.user.role` to client

### Admin Access Checks
- **Helper function:** `requireAdmin(session)` in `server/trpc/router/revenue.ts`
- **Logic:** `session.user.role === "admin" || session.user.role === "super_admin"`
- **Error:** Throws `TRPCError({ code: "FORBIDDEN" })` if not admin

### Revenue Split Model
- **Executive Pool:** 30% split among 7 executives (varying percentages)
- **Strategic Pools:** 20% total (5 pools × 4% each)
  - Leadership Pool (4%)
  - State Pool (4%)
  - Directors Pool (4%)
  - Technology Pool (4%)
  - Investors Pool (4%)
- **Company Reserve:** 50% held for operational expenses

### Revenue Sources (11 Streams)
1. Community Support (CSP)
2. Membership Registration
3. Membership Renewal
4. BPI Store
5. Palliative Programs
6. Student Programs
7. Empowerment Packages
8. Referral Bonuses
9. Withdrawal Fees
10. Late Payment Penalties
11. Other Income

### Code Style Guidelines
- **Notifications:** Always use `toast` from `react-hot-toast`, NEVER `alert()`
- **Forms:** Sharp value text (#232323), lighter placeholder (#b0b0b0)
- **Icons:** react-icons, outline style, inside bordered circles
- **Modals:** Fullscreen/near-fullscreen with backdrop blur (see NotificationsModal.tsx standard)
- **Dark Mode:** All components support dark mode via Tailwind dark: classes
